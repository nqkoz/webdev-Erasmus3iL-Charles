# Agent log

One entry per agent session, newest at the bottom. Be honest: what went wrong is the useful part.

## 2026-10-06 · MCP server implementation
- Goal: Build and test the MCP server for Exercise 1.
- Delegated: Asked the agent to explain the MCP protocol, help implement tools/list and tools/call, and debug the server.
- Checkpoints: Tested initialize, tools/list, find_lecture, tool errors, protocol errors, and reached 12/12 checks.
- Went wrong: student.json was initially missing, causing an ENOENT error. The package.json test script created by npm init also returned exit code 1.
- Changed by hand: Created student.json, tested the server from the terminal, and updated project configuration.
