# <Project name>

<!-- Exercise 2. Write the non-goals first. Every acceptance criterion must be checkable in under a minute.
     Keep these headings exactly as they are: the self-checks look for them by name.
     The full target is on the course site under Resources → The course project. -->

## Project option
<!-- One line: lab booking, study groups, club events, or the own project the lecturer approved. -->

## Goals

## Non-goals

## Constraints

## The model feature
<!-- Which model, which modality, and what it does for a user.
     Name three things or the check fails: the input it receives, the output it produces,
     and what happens when the model is slow, rate-limited or wrong. -->
- Model:
- Input:
- Output:
- When it fails:

## Auth
<!-- Local sign-in plus at least one provider. Say how an account signing in both ways stays one account. -->
- Local:
- Provider:
- Linking:

## MCP tools
<!-- At least three tools your own MCP server exposes over this project's data.
     Each tool calls the same service functions the HTTP API calls, so the same rules apply.
     A description shorter than 20 characters is not a description. -->
| Tool | What it does | Who may call it |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |

## UI
<!-- Stack, and the three or more screens. The graded checklist lives in docs/UI.md. -->

## Architecture
<!-- Exercise 3. One request traced through every layer, naming the file for each one,
     plus one place where your own code does not match this layering. -->

## Acceptance criteria
<!-- Every criterion carries an id. A test proves it by naming that id in its title, for example
     test('AC-3 a booking that overlaps another is refused with 409', ...).
     Say who acts, what they see, and what must be true in the database. -->
- [AC-1] <example> A member who signs up for an event with no free places sees "This event is full", and no new row appears in `registrations`.

### Slice 1: sign-in and <list screen>

## Traceability
<!-- Filled in from Exercise 3 onward: each AC id, and the test that names it. -->
| Criterion | Test |
| --- | --- |
| AC-1 |  |

## Spec vs result
<!-- After the agent builds the slice: which criteria passed, which it missed or reinterpreted, and what you changed in this spec because of it. -->
